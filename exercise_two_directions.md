## Your Turn

1. Create a new branch called `python_branch` and move to it.

def add_values(a, b):
  return a+b
```
3. View the branches.
4. Change back to the `main` or `master` branch.
5. Create a new branch called `markdown_branch` and move to it.
6. Create a file called `new_file.md` and add the following:
```
This is a great markdown file!
```
7. View the branches.
8. Change back to the `main` or `master` branch.
